# Fgraminearum
Code and data for Population Genomic Studies of Fusarium graminearum

## Determining Allele Frequencies of SNPs within _F. graminearum_ population
1. Use [FgramAlleleFreqs.pl](/scripts/FgramAlleleFreqs.pl) script to genetrate a table of allele frequency counts from the FgramHaplotypes.comple.txt file:
```bash
perl FgramAlleleFreqs.pl FgramHaplotypes.complete.txt > FgramAlleleFreqs.txt
```
